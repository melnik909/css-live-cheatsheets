I'm a teacher who helps to learn CSS. I teach people with different knowledge and backgrounds. Students, accountants, kindergarten teachers, developers, etc were my students. I was able to help all of them to level up their CSS skill. Also, I'm the author of a few online boot camps, a speaker at conferences and meetups and a content creator.
